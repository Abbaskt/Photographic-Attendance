# Photographic Attendance

Things to be done.

    1. File to create a dataset (gather_image.py)
    2. File to train the dataset with the name (or a Unique ID) (train.py)
    3. File to recognise faces from an image and store it in a folder (extract_image.py)
    4. File to read images from the folder and recognise names (or UID) of the students (detect.py)


# Gatherimage.py 
    
      Have used OpenCV for face detection and gathering. Method used is "Haar Cascading Classifier", it is the common way to detect any face (or any objects).
      Object Detection using Haar feature-based cascade classifiers is an effective object detection method proposed by Paul Viola and Michael Jones in their paper,       “Rapid Object Detection using a Boosted Cascade of Simple Features” in 2001. It is a machine learning based approach where a cascade function is trained from       a lot of positive and negative images. It is then used to detect objects in other images.The code will explain how it detects and gathers images.
